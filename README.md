# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my repository of data analysis projects! This repository showcases a collection of projects where I apply various data analysis techniques to extract insights from different datasets. Each project is designed to demonstrate my skills in data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis using Python libraries.

## Projects
Here is a list of projects included in this repository:

1. **Automobile Price Analysis**
   - Analyzed features impacting automobile prices using statistical methods and visualizations.
   - Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

2. **Sales Data Analysis**
   - This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data, covering data cleaning, transformation, and insightful visualizations. The goal is to uncover key sales metrics and trends over       time, by state, city, and hour.
   - Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  
3. **Box Office Data Analysis**
   - This project provides an in-depth analysis of movie data, focusing on various factors affecting box office revenue. The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualizations The goal is to identify insights that can guide decision-making in the film industry.
   - Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, WordCloud
