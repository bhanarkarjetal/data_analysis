# Sales Data Analysis
This repository contains a comprehensive sales data analysis covering data cleaning, transformation, and insightful visualizations. The goal is to uncover key sales metrics and trends over time, by state, city, and hour.

## Project Steps

1. **Importing Libraries**: Loaded essential Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including pandas, os, matplotlib, and seaborn.

2. **Joining Yearly Sales Data by Month**: Combined sales data of 12 months, aggregating it for trend analysis.

3. **Checking for Null Values**: Identified missing data points that could impact analysis accuracy.

4. **Checking for Empty Rows**: Ensured data consistency by identifying empty rows in the dataset.

5. **Removing Empty Rows**: Removed rows with missing data to maintain data integrity.

6. **Changing Data Types of Columns for Calculations**: Adjusted data types (e.g., converting columns to numeric types) to facilitate mathematical operations.

7. **Sales Calculations**: Calculated key sales metrics:

- Yearly Sales: Total sales per year.
- Sales by State: Breakdown of sales by state.
- Sales by City: Further breakdown of sales by individual cities.
- Hourly Sales: Sales distribution by hour to understand peak times.
- Visualizing Sales for Bill Amount
- Created visualizations to show sales trends with the bill amount, helping to reveal insights about customer spending behavior.

8. **Visualizing Sales with Respect to Bill Amount**:
Created visualizations to show sales trends in relation to the bill amount, helping to reveal insights about customer spending behavior.
