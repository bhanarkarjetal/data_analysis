# Automobile Price Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of an automobile dataset, focusing on features that significantly impact the target variable, **price**. The analysis utilizes various Python libraries, including **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **SciPy**.

## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical graphics
- **SciPy**: For statistical analysis

## Project Overview
In this analysis, I have performed the following steps:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Imported necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.
2. **Importing Dataset**: Loaded the automobile dataset from [Kaggle]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fazilbtopal/auto85/data)).
3. **Cleaning Data**: Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

### Data Analysis of Numeric Features
- **Feature Selection**: Identified relevant numeric features influencing the price.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized Seaborn's `regplot` and `histplot` to visualize the relationships between numeric features and price.

### Data Analysis of Categorical Features
- **Feature Selection**: Selected important categorical features that could affect the price.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employed one-way ANOVA to assess the significance of categorical features in relation to price.

## Summary
This project provides insights into the factors influencing automobile prices, demonstrating the application of various data analysis techniques. Through visualizations and statistical tests, I have highlighted key relationships within the dataset.
